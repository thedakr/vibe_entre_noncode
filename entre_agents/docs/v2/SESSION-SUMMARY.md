## How to Complete the Framework

### Option A: Do It Yourself
1. Use the 6 agent templates as patterns
2. Follow the structure exactly for consistency
3. Adapt domain-specific content for each agent
4. Reference Part 1 & 2 for concepts to apply
5. Use Part 4 & 5 for system integration

**Timeline:** 60-100 hours over 2-4 weeks

### Option B: Use AI Assistance
1. Provide Claude with an agent template and domain description
2. Generate draft specification
3. Review and refine for accuracy
4. Ensure consistency with system architecture

**Timeline:** 30-50 hours over 1-2 weeks

### Option C: Team Collaboration
1. Assign agents to different team members
2. Use templates to ensure consistency
3. Review together for coherence
4. Integrate into complete framework
