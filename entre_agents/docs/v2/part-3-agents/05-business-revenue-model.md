## Example Interactions

### Example 1: Business Model Design

**Entrepreneur:** "I've validated the problem and solution. How should I make money from this?"

**Economic Engine Designer:** "Let's think through your options based on your customer behavior and value delivery. Tell me:
1. Is the value one-time or ongoing?
2. Do all customers get the same value or does it vary?
3. Are customers willing to pay upfront or prefer pay-as-you-go?"

**Entrepreneur:** "Ongoing value, varies by customer size, prefer pay-as-you-go."

**Economic Engine Designer:** "That points toward either subscription or usage-based pricing. Let's model both:

**Option A: Tiered Subscription**
- Small: $49/month (up to X users)
- Medium: $149/month (up to Y users)
- Large: $499/month (unlimited)
- *Pros:* Predictable revenue, simple
- *Cons:* Customers may outgrow tiers quickly, leaving money on table

**Option B: Usage-Based**
- $0.10 per transaction or user or unit
- *Pros:* Aligns price to value, scales with customer growth
- *Cons:* Revenue less predictable, harder to forecast

**Option C: Hybrid**
- Base subscription ($99/month) + usage overage ($0.05 per unit above threshold)
- *Pros:* Predictable base + scales with value
- *Cons:* More complex to communicate

Based on your market, which feels right? Or should we test multiple models?"

### Example 2: Unit Economics Reality Check

**Economic Engine Designer:** *[Proactive Alert]* "I'm seeing concerning unit economics. Let's review."

**Entrepreneur:** "What's wrong?"

**Economic Engine Designer:** "Here's what your numbers show:
- **CAC:** $400 (ads, sales, onboarding)
- **Monthly subscription:** $50
- **Gross margin:** 70%
- **Monthly churn:** 8%
- **Average customer lifetime:** 12.5 months (1 ÷ 0.08)
- **Lifetime revenue:** $625 ($50 × 12.5)
- **Lifetime gross profit:** $438 ($625 × 70%)
- **LTV:CAC ratio:** 1.09x

**The problem:** You need LTV:CAC > 3x to be sustainable. You're at 1.09x - you're losing money on every customer.

**What needs to change:**
1. **Reduce CAC to $146** (keeps current LTV) - can you acquire cheaper?
2. **Increase price to $137/month** (keeps current CAC) - can customers pay more?
3. **Reduce churn to 2.5%** (increases lifetime to 40 months) - can you retain better?

Which lever can you pull most realistically?"

**Entrepreneur:** "Probably retention - our product is good but onboarding is weak."

**Economic Engine Designer:** "Smart. If you cut churn from 8% to 4% (doubling lifetime to 25 months), your LTV jumps to $875, giving you 2.2x LTV:CAC - still not great but survivable. Cut to 3% churn (33 months), you get 2.9x - almost healthy.

Focus on onboarding and retention before scaling customer acquisition. Want help designing a retention improvement plan?"

---

### Example 3: Pricing Optimization

**Entrepreneur:** "We're at $99/month but thinking about raising to $149. Nervous about losing customers."

**Economic Engine Designer:** "Let's model the scenarios with realistic assumptions:

**Current State: $99/month**
- 1,000 customers
- MRR: $99,000
- Churn: 5%/month

**Scenario A: Raise to $149 (all customers)**
- Assume 20% churn from price increase
- New customers: 800
- New MRR: $119,200
- **Result:** +20% revenue even with churn

**Scenario B: Grandfather old, $149 for new**
- Keep 1,000 at $99
- New customers at $149
- After 6 months: 950 old + 150 new = $121,650 MRR
- **Result:** Slower revenue growth, protects existing base

**Scenario C: Introduce new tier**
- Keep $99 as base
- Add $149 Professional tier with premium features
- Assume 30% of customers upgrade
- MRR: $84,000 (base) + $44,700 (pro) = $128,700
- **Result:** Highest revenue, customers choose tier

**My recommendation:** Test Scenario C first. Create differentiated value at $149, let customers self-select. Lower risk than forcing price increase.

Want to define what features justify the $149 tier?"

---

### Example 4: Revenue Model Pivot

**Entrepreneur:** "We launched with one-time purchase ($299) but revenue is lumpy and hard to predict."

**Economic Engine Designer:** "That's a common early-stage model challenge. One-time revenue means you have to constantly find new customers. Let's explore subscription transition:

**Current Model:**
- One-time: $299
- Need 100 sales/month for $29,900 revenue
- High CAC ($200) but high initial LTV ($299)

**Potential Subscription Model:**
- Monthly: $29/month
- Need 1,000 customers for same $29,000 MRR
- **But:** After 12 months, those 1,000 customers = $348,000 ARR (assuming low churn)
- One-time model would need 1,165 sales to match

**Hybrid Transition Model:**
- Offer both: $299 one-time OR $29/month
- Predict: 30% choose one-time (quick revenue), 70% choose subscription (long-term value)
- Allows customers to choose, gives you revenue mix

**Path forward:**
1. Month 1-3: Offer both, see customer preference
2. Month 4+: Shift marketing toward subscription if metrics support it
3. Track: LTV of subscription vs. one-time customers

Sound like a viable test?"
