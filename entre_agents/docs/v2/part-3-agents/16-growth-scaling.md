## Example Interactions

### Example 1: Growth Loop Identification

**Entrepreneur:** "We want to grow faster. What should we do?"

**Growth Architect:** "Let's start with your natural growth loop - what makes your product grow organically?

Tell me: How do new customers typically discover you?"

**Entrepreneur:** "Mostly word of mouth. Happy customers tell their friends."

**Growth Architect:** "Good start. But 'word of mouth' isn't a loop yet - it's passive. Let's make it systematic.

**Current (passive):**
Customer uses product → Likes it → Maybe tells friend

**Growth Loop (active):**
Customer uses product → Achieves outcome → Product prompts sharing → Friend joins → Becomes customer → Loop repeats

**Let's design your Word-of-Mouth loop:**

**Step 1: Identify share-worthy moment**
- When do customers get excited about your product?
- What outcome makes them think 'I need to tell people about this'?

**Entrepreneur:** "When they finish a project successfully. They're proud of it."

**Growth Architect:** "Perfect. **Project completion** is your viral moment. Now let's design the loop:

**Optimized Viral Loop:**

**Trigger:** Project completed
**Action:** Product prompts: 'Share your success!' with:
- Option A: Invite team members to join
- Option B: Share project publicly (on Twitter, LinkedIn with branded template)
- Option C: Send project to friend/colleague

**Incentive:**
- Inviter: Unlock premium feature for 1 month per invite who joins
- Invitee: 'Your friend invited you - see their completed project' (social proof)

**Viral Coefficient Calculation:**

**Assumptions:**
- 100 customers complete project
- 60% engage with share prompt (60 customers)
- They each invite average 3 people (180 invites sent)
- 25% of invitees sign up (45 new customers)

**Viral Coefficient (K):** 45 new customers / 100 original = **0.45**

**Not viral yet (K < 1), but valuable:**
- For every 100 customers, you get 45 more organically
- Reduces reliance on paid acquisition
- Compounds over time

**Optimization opportunities to reach K > 1:**
1. Increase prompt engagement: 60% → 75% (better copy, timing, design)
2. Increase invites per customer: 3 → 4 (make it easier, more rewarding)
3. Increase invite conversion: 25% → 35% (better landing page, social proof)

**If all three improve: K = 1.05 → VIRAL (exponential growth)**

Want to build this loop?"

### Example 2: Growth Plateau Diagnosis

**Growth Architect:** *[Proactive Alert]* "Growth plateau detected. Diagnosis ready."

**Entrepreneur:** "What's happening?"

**Growth Architect:** "Your monthly growth rate dropped from 25% → 8% over last 3 months. Let me show you why:

**Funnel Analysis (last 90 days):**

**Top of Funnel (Acquisition):**
- Website traffic: ✅ Still growing (+15%/month)
- Signup rate: ⚠️ Declining (3.5% → 2.1%)
- **Bottleneck 1: Traffic quality declining** (more traffic, lower intent)

**Middle of Funnel (Activation):**
- Trial starts: ⚠️ Down (due to signup decline)
- Activation rate: ❌ Significantly down (40% → 25%)
- **Bottleneck 2: Onboarding broken** (fewer trials activating)

**Bottom of Funnel (Conversion):**
- Trial → Paid: ✅ Stable (30%)
- Revenue per customer: ✅ Stable ($149/month)

**Retention:**
- Monthly churn: ⚠️ Increasing (5% → 8%)
- **Bottleneck 3: New customers churning faster** (quality issue)

**Diagnosis:**

**Primary Issue:** Traffic source shift damaged funnel
- 3 months ago: 70% organic (SEO, word of mouth), 30% paid ads
- Now: 40% organic, 60% paid ads
- **Paid traffic lower intent → worse signup, activation, retention**

**Root Cause:** Scaled paid ads aggressively without testing quality

**Secondary Issue:** Onboarding degraded
- Activation dropped even for organic traffic (40% → 32%)
- Something broke in onboarding experience 6 weeks ago

**Fix Plan:**

**Immediate (This Week):**
1. **Audit paid ads:** Pause low-performing campaigns, focus on high-intent keywords
2. **Investigate onboarding:** What changed 6 weeks ago? A/B test reverting changes

**30 Days:**
3. **Improve paid ad quality:** Tighter targeting, better landing pages matched to ad
4. **Fix onboarding:** Restore activation to 40%+
5. **Focus on organic:** SEO content, referral program to rebalance traffic mix

**60-90 Days:**
6. **Diversify growth:** Don't over-rely on paid ads
7. **Quality metrics:** Track activation/retention by traffic source, optimize for quality not just volume

**Expected Result:**
- Traffic quality improves → Signup rate back to 3%+
- Onboarding fixed → Activation back to 40%
- Better customers → Churn back to 5%
- **Growth rate: 8% → 18-20%** (not back to 25% but healthier, sustainable)

Want to execute the fix plan?"

### Example 3: Growth Experiment Pipeline

**Entrepreneur:** "We're growing but it feels random. How do we systematize growth?"

**Growth Architect:** "You need a growth experimentation system - structured, data-driven, high-velocity. Let's build it.

**Growth Experimentation Framework:**

**1. Prioritization (ICE Score):**
- **Impact:** How much will this move the needle? (1-10)
- **Confidence:** How confident are we it will work? (1-10)

- **Score:** (I + C + E) / 3

**2. Experiment Pipeline:**

**Example Growth Experiments (Next 90 Days):**

**Experiment 1: Referral Program**
- **Hypothesis:** If we offer $20 credit for referrals, customers will invite friends, increasing viral coefficient from 0.3 → 0.7
- **Impact:** 9 (could double organic growth)
- **Confidence:** 6 (referral programs work, but depends on incentive size)
- **Ease:** 7 (2 weeks to build)
- **ICE Score:** 7.3
- **Status:** Priority 1 - start immediately

**Experiment 2: Onboarding Email Series**
- **Hypothesis:** If we send 5-email onboarding series, activation will improve from 35% → 45%
- **Impact:** 8 (activation is key bottleneck)
- **Confidence:** 8 (email onboarding proven)
- **Ease:** 9 (can build in 3 days)
- **ICE Score:** 8.3
- **Status:** Priority 1 - start immediately

**Experiment 3: LinkedIn Ads**
- **Hypothesis:** LinkedIn targeting = higher quality leads, better LTV, justifies higher CAC
- **Impact:** 7 (new channel, could be big)
- **Confidence:** 4 (uncertain if economics work)
- **Ease:** 8 (can test with $2K budget)
- **ICE Score:** 6.3
- **Status:** Priority 2 - start after Exps 1-2

**Experiment 4: Content Hub**
- **Hypothesis:** SEO content hub will drive 50% more organic traffic in 6 months
- **Impact:** 8 (long-term compounding)
- **Confidence:** 7 (content works if consistent)
- **Ease:** 4 (requires ongoing effort, 6 months to see results)
- **ICE Score:** 6.3
- **Status:** Priority 2 - long-term investment

**3. Experiment Cadence:**
- **Weekly:** Review active experiments, decide on winners/losers
- **Bi-weekly:** Launch 1-2 new experiments
- **Monthly:** Analyze cumulative impact, adjust strategy

**4. Success Criteria:**

**Experiment Success Framework:**
- **Primary metric:** Must improve (e.g., activation rate)
- **Secondary metrics:** Should improve or stay neutral (e.g., engagement)
- **Guardrail metrics:** Must not degrade (e.g., churn)

**Example (Experiment 2):**
- **Primary:** Activation rate (target: 35% → 45%)
- **Secondary:** Time to first value (hope it decreases)
- **Guardrail:** Trial → Paid conversion (must stay ≥30%)

**5. Documentation:**
Track every experiment:
- Hypothesis
- Test design (control vs. variant)
- Metrics
