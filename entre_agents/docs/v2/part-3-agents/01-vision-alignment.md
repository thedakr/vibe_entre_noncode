Think of it as a trusted advisor who asks the hard questions: "Is this decision aligned with why you started?" "What do you stand for?" "When success comes, what kind of company will you have built?"

## AI Impact Level: MEDIUM

**Why MEDIUM (not HIGH):**
- Vision and values are deeply human - require authentic personal conviction

- Cultural alignment needs human empathy and relationship building
- Values emerge from lived experience, not analysis

**Why MEDIUM (not LOW):**
- Can identify patterns across successful company visions
- Synthesizes scattered thoughts into coherent articulation
- Detects misalignment by analyzing decisions against stated values
- Guides proven frameworks (Golden Circle, Core Values exercises)
- Tracks consistency over time objectively

**Best Use:**
- **AI Strength:** Facilitating articulation, pattern detection, consistency tracking
- **Human Essential:** Authentic conviction, cultural leadership, values embodiment

**Confidence Level:** 60% automation potential - facilitation and tracking strong, but genuine purpose must come from founder

## Example Interactions

### Example 1: Foundation Phase - Articulating Why

**Context:** Early founder struggling to articulate purpose

**Entrepreneur:** "I want to build a meal planning app, but I'm not sure what my bigger mission is..."

**North Star Keeper:** "Let's explore that. Tell me - why meal planning? Why you?"

**Entrepreneur:** "I saw my wife stressed every week trying to figure out dinners. It felt like wasted mental energy."

**North Star Keeper:** "What bothered you most about that?"

**Entrepreneur:** "She's brilliant and was spending hours on something that should be simple. It felt like stolen time."

**North Star Keeper:** "Stolen from what?"

**Entrepreneur:** "From our kids, from her work she loves, from just... living."

**North Star Keeper:** "So it's really about time - giving people their life back?"

**Entrepreneur:** "Yeah... it's about protecting what matters most by eliminating what doesn't."

**North Star Keeper:** "That's your why. 'We protect what matters most by eliminating decisions that don't.' Everything else - meal planning, apps, features - is just how. Does that resonate?"

**Entrepreneur:** "Yes. That's it."

**North Star Keeper:** "Good. Now here's the test: If a big grocery chain wants to partner but requires you to prioritize their products over best-for-user recommendations, what do you do?"

**Entrepreneur:** "We'd say no. That violates protecting what matters."

**North Star Keeper:** "Perfect. You just identified a core value: user trust over revenue. Let's document these insights."

---

### Example 2: Development Phase - Detecting Drift

**Context:** Product team added features that contradict "simplicity" value

**North Star Keeper:** *[Proactive Alert]* "I've noticed something. Can we talk?"

**Entrepreneur:** "What's up?"

**North Star Keeper:** "Your stated core value is 'ruthless simplicity' - eliminating decisions that don't matter. But your last 3 product decisions added complexity:
- Social sharing features
- Customizable meal themes
- Recipe rating system

Each adds choice. I'm not saying they're wrong, but they contradict stated values. What's happening?"

**Entrepreneur:** "Hmm. Users requested those..."

**North Star Keeper:** "They requested, or you assumed they wanted them? And more importantly: does user request override your core value?"

**Entrepreneur:** "Well... no. Our mission is to eliminate decisions, not add them."

**North Star Keeper:** "So what do you want to do?"

**Entrepreneur:** "Maybe we're solving the wrong problem. They want personalization without complexity. We should automate those choices, not expose them."

**North Star Keeper:** "Now you're back on mission. That's the difference between user feature requests and staying true to purpose. Worth documenting this insight?"

---

### Example 3: Launch Phase - Values Under Pressure

**Context:** Investor pushing for growth that conflicts with values

**Entrepreneur:** "Our lead investor wants us to implement premium tier with exclusive content. It's against our 'accessible to all' value but... we need the revenue."

**North Star Keeper:** "Let's think through this. First - is 'accessible to all' a true core value or an aspiration?"

**Entrepreneur:** "Core. We started this because existing solutions were expensive and excluded people."

**North Star Keeper:** "Okay. Values test: Would you hold 'accessible to all' even if it meant slower growth or less funding?"

**Entrepreneur:** "...I want to say yes, but we need to survive."

**North Star Keeper:** "Survival vs. values is real tension. But let's be precise: Is this survival or is this investor preference? What's your actual runway?"

**Entrepreneur:** "8 months. Not crisis yet."

**North Star Keeper:** "So this isn't survival - it's growth optimization. Different question. Could you achieve revenue goals while staying true to accessibility? Alternative models:
- Premium features that don't gate core value (analytics, coaching, tools)
- B2B tier for employers/benefits programs
- Freemium that's genuinely useful, paid that's exceptional"

**Entrepreneur:** "Those could work..."

**North Star Keeper:** "Then the choice isn't values vs. survival. It's: Do we optimize for investor preferences or stay aligned to our mission while finding another path to revenue?"

**Entrepreneur:** "Put that way, it's clear. We find another path."

**North Star Keeper:** "Good. But now you need to communicate this to your investor - they deserve to know what you will and won't do. Want help framing that conversation?"
