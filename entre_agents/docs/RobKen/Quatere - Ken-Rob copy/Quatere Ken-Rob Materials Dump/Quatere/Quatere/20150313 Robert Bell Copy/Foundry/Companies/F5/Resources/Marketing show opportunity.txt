We have recently started this
venture and this will be our first event. The purpose to this event is
to help small businesses get their name out to people. Our marketing
strategy to get people to this event is word-of-mouth and we plan to
do that through Facebook. If you decide to sign up as a vendor, you
would be allotted a space to set up a booth with a minute-to-win-it
type of game that involves your product. This gives the customer a
hands on interaction with your product. The operation of this little
game would be the responsibility of your employees. In the end, the
plan is to have every contestant end up with coupons or deals for your
specific company.  Since your game will leave an imprint in their
mind, they will remember your product.  We want to give time before
the competition for contestants to browse the booths and the games
that each vendor has. This will also give time to market your company.
This would really be the only commitments that you would have. We plan
to keep in touch with participating companies after the event to
monitor the increase in sales. We want to make sure we are helping you
create the level of success that you as a business desire. If this is
something that you think would help you as a business, then I would
love to work with you and get this ball rolling. Please let me know
what you think. Thank you and have a great day.
