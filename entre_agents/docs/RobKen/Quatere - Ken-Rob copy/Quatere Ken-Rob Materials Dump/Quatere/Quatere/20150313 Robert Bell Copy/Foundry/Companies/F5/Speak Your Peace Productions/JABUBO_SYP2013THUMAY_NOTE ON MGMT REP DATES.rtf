\f0\fs24 \cf0 Included in this folder are management reports for Speak Your Peace Productions L.L.C. from April 2013 to current. I intend to share these reports in this Foundry 5 folder until the end of May out of principle, as my schedule conflicts kept me from being able to fully participate in F5 Fall 2012.\
\
It turns out that it's a difficult feat to be able to run a production company. It has taken 9 months to produce a professional quality podcast independently, and to recruit crew members volunteer to begin with. As such, these management reports are dated a whole season later after 6 months worth of effort when I was able to make the social connections necessary to be where I am today.\
\
As of current, Speak Your Peace Productions has publish the first episode of The 801 Podcast: http://thisis801.tumblr.com/post/49445356074/questions-44-16-experiences-of-coming-into\
\
Any feedback is appreciate.\
\
We have also launched our first Kickstarter campaign for The 801 Web Series: http://kck.st/10VOk5k\
\
Please spread the word, and contribute any way you can to the project.\
\
Check out 801 on Facebook, 801Series on Twitter, and our Tumblr at http://thisis801.tumblr.com.\
\
I look forward to applying to participate in the Foundry again in the future at a more opportune time once Speak Your Peace has more media produced, and our team is more solid.\
\
Thank you for the support, \
