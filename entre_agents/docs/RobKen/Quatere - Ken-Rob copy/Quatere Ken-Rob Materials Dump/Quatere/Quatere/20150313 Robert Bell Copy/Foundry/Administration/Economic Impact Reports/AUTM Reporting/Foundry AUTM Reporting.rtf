\cf2 We would like to know (1) firms that were new meeting the above criteria and (2) the sales and employees of all firms with ongoing operations who are \'d2graduates\'d3 of the Foundry. We will use the #1 data in our annual report to AUTM and the #2 data will be used in our annual economic impact update we have commissioned with BEBR.\
\
If by any chance there were qualifying firms that fall in the July 1, 2009 to June 30, 2010 reporting period, we can report them to AUTM now (deadline is May 17). Since there is a considerable lag in the reporting period, we are typically filling out the survey using our prior year annual report. I would like to have the data. Peggy, who works in TCO, fills out the actual survey.\
\
We will be submitting our July 1, 2010 to June 20, 2011 (FY 11) data to BEBR by July 15. This is a roster of companies operating as of June 30, 2011 and employment numbers, which they in turn use to generate indirect and induced employment, overall payroll, state domestic product impact, and tax impact. They may have some problems generating a report this year with the Foundry numbers because the industry indicators they have for our companies are highly skewed toward life sciences, but I will give it a shot.}
